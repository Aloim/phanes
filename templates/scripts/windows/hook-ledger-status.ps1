# only surfaces the state. Run by hand with terminal stdin it exits 0 at once, never blocking.

# Guarded JSON read with the FOUR outcomes a sensor has to be able to tell apart. Returns a
# hashtable with Status ('ok' | 'absent' | 'unreadable' | 'malformed'), Value (the parsed
# object on 'ok', $null otherwise) and Reason (one line, on the two failure states).
#
# 'absent' and 'unreadable' are DIFFERENT ANSWERS, and conflating them is the fabricated empty
# set the Global Constraints ban outright. Two separate mechanisms produced that conflation in
# the draft and both are closed here:
#   1. Get-Content -Raw on a 0-byte file emits $null, so the pipeline never reaches
#      ConvertFrom-Json and the catch never fires. A 0-byte file is the canonical interrupted-
#      write corruption, which makes it the single most likely real-world case and exactly the
#      one the guard missed.
#   2. Whitespace-only, literal null, bare-array and bare-string contents all PARSE cleanly, so
#      the catch never fires either, and the caller then reads a member off a value that has
#      none and silently gets $null.
# RequireMember closes (2) for a caller that knows its shape: pass 'artifacts' and a parsed
# value that is not an object carrying that member is 'malformed' rather than 'ok'.
#
# The result hashtable is a bare @{} on purpose: its keys are three fixed literals, never user
# content, so the Ordinal rule does not apply to it.
